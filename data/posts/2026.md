# Defining the Mission for 2026

A new year is a moment to `step back` and `choose direction with clarity`.

2026 is about commitment—showing up consistently, staying disciplined, and continuing forward even when progress isn’t obvious. `The path matters more than the pace, and growth comes from persistence, not noise.`

## Milestones Ahead

Certifications remain part of the journey, not as an end goal but as structure along the way. This year’s targets are `CJCA`, `CPTS`, and `OSCP`—checkpoints meant to reinforce focus and accountability rather than define success.

## Acknowledgments

I’m grateful to those who supported me when results didn’t yet speak for themselves. To the people who believed, pushed, and guided me quietly—your impact goes far beyond anything written here.

I’m also thankful for music, friends, family. For the moments they carried focus, drowned out doubt, and stayed present when everything else felt uncertain.

## Closing

No rush. No performance.
Just forward motion.
