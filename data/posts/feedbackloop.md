# Does your mind ever feel like a castle
# that you just can’t find the keys to?

Or let me put it this way: have you ever gained enough awareness to realize how much you don't know, effectively paralyzing any feeling of growth? Yeah, a bit heavy, right?

This month didn’t start off so well for me, but to spare you the boring aspects of my life, here’s a (very) brief summary:

> Been sick. 
> Winter Break’s over. 
> Responsibilities grew.
> And I got a personal objective to meet (more like a couple, actually).


# And here’s where the title comes into play

I bought this book right before summer ended, it’s called “The Subtle Art Of Not Giving a F*ck” by Mark Manson. Quite a mouthful there.

Well, I’m not going to spoil the book for you, but one of the chapters talks about something called the "Feedback Loop from Hell," and here’s an example:

> You look at the syllabus and tell yourself, “The CJCA should be easy for me.”
> You start procrastinating because failing something you labeled “easy” would feel embarrassing.
> Then you worry about the procrastination.
> That worry makes you avoid studying even more.
> Now you’re stressed not about the CJCA, but about your own stress and delay — that’s the feedback loop from hell for ya.

And yes it sounds very stupid, and yes it is childish, but it is also true—at least for me.


# Great, how does this impact me?

Well, it depends.

The loop feeds itself—hence the name. From what I’ve learned so far, this is especially dangerous in offensive security (though not limited to it). Offensive work requires trial & error, constant failure, and frequently looking stupid in front of machines.

The feedback loop punishes that failure emotionally. When you are already under pressure from time constraints or workload, the loop convinces you that a failed exploit isn't just a technical issue, but a personal one.

But here is the reality: **Failure is a learning mechanism.**

Avoiding your weaknesses or protecting an inflated self-image? Yeah, that isn’t going to get you anywhere…

# Update
92,7% done with the CJCA path and will hopefully be attempting the exam next month.
